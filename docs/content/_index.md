[`cointop`](https://github.com/cointop-sh/cointop) is a fast and lightweight interactive terminal based UI application for tracking and monitoring cryptocurrency coin stats in real-time.

The interface is inspired by [`htop`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Htop) and shortcut keys are inspired by [`vim`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)).
